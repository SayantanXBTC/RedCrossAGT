# Production Environment Variables for Netlify Deployment

# IMPORTANT: Your local backend needs to be exposed to the internet
# Option 1: Use ngrok - Run: ngrok http 5000
# Then replace the URL below with your ngrok URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io/api)

# Option 2: Deploy backend to a cloud service (Render, Railway, Heroku, etc.)
# Then replace with your deployed backend URL

# For now, this points to localhost (won't work from Netlify)
# You MUST replace this with a publicly accessible URL
VITE_API_URL=https://redcrosstrp.netlify.app

# After setting up ngrok or deploying backend, update to:
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api
# OR
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com/api
